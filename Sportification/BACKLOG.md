## 🔍 Technical Debt

### Current Known Issues
None identified - all screens are complete and functional.

### Potential Future Issues
1. **State Management:** As app grows, consider migrating to Zustand or Jotai for better performance
2. **Navigation:** May need React Navigation v7 when released for better performance
3. **Dependencies:** Keep dependencies updated (especially react-native-reanimated)

---

## 📝 Notes

### Decision Log
- **2025-01**: Chose react-native-reanimated over Animated API for better performance
- **2025-01**: Decided on Material Design 3 as design language
- **2025-01**: Created reusable components after identifying patterns in 22 screens

### Lessons Learned
1. Identifying patterns early saves significant refactoring time
2. Centralized constants prevent inconsistencies
3. Custom hooks dramatically reduce code duplication
4. Comprehensive theme system makes styling consistent and maintainable
