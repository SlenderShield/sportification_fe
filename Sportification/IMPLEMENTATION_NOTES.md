# Implementation Notes - Sportification Mobile App

## What's Been Built

### Core Architecture ✅
- **Redux Store**: Configured with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for efficient state management and API caching
- **API Service Layer**: Axios-based service with JWT auto-refresh interceptors and secure token storage using react-native-keychain
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time service with exponential backoff reconnection logic
- **Navigation**: React Navigation setup with Auth and Main stacks, state-based route switching

### Security ✅
- **Secure Token Storage**: Implemented using react-native-keychain (Keychain on iOS, KeyStore on Android)
- **Auto-Refresh**: JWT tokens automatically refresh on 401 errors without user intervention
- **Secure Logout**: Properly clears tokens and disconnects Socket.IO on logout

### Authentication & User Management ✅
- Login screen with validation
- Registration screen with password confirmation
- Profile screen with user stats and achievements
- Friend management API integration (search, add, remove)
- Password change API endpoint configured

### Screens Implemented

#### Functional ✅
- **LoginScreen**: Email/password authentication with validation
- **RegisterScreen**: User registration with form validation
- **ProfileScreen**: User profile, stats, achievements display
- **MatchesScreen**: List view with pagination and refresh
- **TournamentsScreen**: Tournament listing with status badges
- **VenuesScreen**: Venue discovery with sports tags
- **ChatsScreen**: Chat list view

#### Common Components ✅
- Button: Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, outline) and loading states
- Input: Text input with label and error message support
- LoadingSpinner: Centered loading indicator

### API Integration ✅

All RTK Query API slices configured for:
- **Auth API**: login, register, profile, password change, stats, achievements, friends
- **Match API**: CRUD operations, join/leave, score updates, status changes
- **Tournament API**: CRUD, join/leave, start tournament
- **Team API**: CRUD, join/leave, member management
- **Venue API**: listing, details, booking CRUD, availability checking
- **Chat API**: chat listing, messages, send message
- **Notification API**: list, mark as read, mark all as read

### Type Definitions ✅

Comprehensive TypeScript types for:
- API responses and requests
- Auth (User, Profile, Tokens, Stats, Achievements)
- Matches (Match, Participant, Score, Filters)
- Tournaments (Tournament, Bracket, Standings)
- Teams (Team, Members)
- Venues (Venue, Booking, Availability)
- Chat (Chat, Message, Participants)
- Notifications

## What's Missing / TODO

### Critical for MVP

1. **Missing Screen Routes** ⚠️
   - MatchDetail screen (referenced in navigation)
   - CreateMatch screen
   - TournamentDetail screen with bracket view
   - CreateTournament screen
   - VenueDetail screen with booking form
   - ChatDetail screen (message thread)
   - CreateBooking flow
   - MyBookings screen
   - EditProfile screen
   - ChangePassword screen
   - Friends screen

2. **Push Notifications** ⚠️
   - Firebase setup (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist)
   - FCM token registration
   - Push notification handlers
   - Local notification display
   - Badge count management

3. **Socket.IO Integration** ⚠️
   - Wire Socket.IO into chat screens for real-time messages
   - Implement room join/leave in chat detail
   - Handle real-time match/tournament updates
   - Connect to notification events

4. **Error Handling** ⚠️
   - Global error boundary
   - Network error retry UI
   - Offline mode indicators
   - Better error messages for form validation

5. **Team Management** ⚠️
   - Complete team screens (list, detail, create)
   - Team member management UI

### Nice to Have

- Pull-to-refresh on all list screens (partially done)
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Image upload for profiles/venues
- Map integration for venue locations
- Deep linking support
- Biometric authentication
- Offline caching with persistence
- Optimistic UI updates
- Analytics integration
- Crash reporting (Sentry/Firebase Crashlytics)

## Known Issues

### Fixed ✅
- ~~Navigation crash after login (route 'Main' not found)~~ - FIXED: Removed manual navigation, using auth state
- ~~Insecure token storage in AsyncStorage~~ - FIXED: Migrated to react-native-keychain
- ~~Direct fetch bypassing Axios interceptors~~ - FIXED: Using Axios instance in RootNavigator

### Outstanding ⚠️
- No screen implementations for create/detail flows
- Socket.IO not integrated into UI
- Push notifications not set up
- No form validation library integration (mentioned yup but not used)
- Date formatting not fully implemented across screens
- Some API endpoints may not match actual backend structure (needs backend testing)

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Needed
1. Login/Register flow with backend
2. Token refresh on 401 error
3. Logout clears all state
4. Match/Tournament/Venue listing with real data
5. Socket.IO connection and reconnection
6. Profile stats and achievements loading

### Automated Testing TODO
- Unit tests for Redux slices
- Integration tests for API services
- Component tests for screens
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Deployment Readiness

### iOS
- ⚠️ Info.plist permissions needed (camera, location if used)
- ⚠️ Push notification entitlements
- ⚠️ App icon and launch screen
- ✅ Secure keychain storage configured

### Android
- ⚠️ AndroidManifest.xml permissions
- ⚠️ Push notification setup
- ⚠️ App icon and splash screen
- ✅ KeyStore integration configured
- ⚠️ ProGuard rules if using

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ RTK Query caching enabled (reduces API calls)
- ✅ Pagination on list screens
- ⚠️ No image optimization yet
- ⚠️ No lazy loading for heavy components
- ⚠️ Socket connections not optimized (should disconnect on background)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement missing screens** (priority order):
   - ChatDetail (for real-time messaging demo)
   - MatchDetail and CreateMatch
   - VenueDetail and CreateBooking
   - TournamentDetail with bracket view

2. **Complete Socket.IO integration**:
   - Connect chat UI to Socket.IO events
   - Implement message send/receive in real-time
   - Handle typing indicators and read receipts

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Add Firebase config files
   - Implement FCM token registration
   - Handle push notifications

4. **Testing with backend**:
   - Update .env with backend URL
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Fix any schema mismatches

5. **Polish**:
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Improve error messages
   - Add success feedback
   - Implement pull-to-refresh everywhere
