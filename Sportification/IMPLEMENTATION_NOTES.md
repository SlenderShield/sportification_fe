## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Needed
1. Login/Register flow with backend
2. Token refresh on 401 error
3. Logout clears all state
4. Match/Tournament/Venue listing with real data
5. Socket.IO connection and reconnection
6. Profile stats and achievements loading

### Automated Testing TODO
- Unit tests for Redux slices
- Integration tests for API services
- Component tests for screens
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Deployment Readiness

### iOS
- ⚠️ Info.plist permissions needed (camera, location if used)
- ⚠️ Push notification entitlements
- ⚠️ App icon and launch screen
- ✅ Secure keychain storage configured

### Android
- ⚠️ AndroidManifest.xml permissions
- ⚠️ Push notification setup
- ⚠️ App icon and splash screen
- ✅ KeyStore integration configured
- ⚠️ ProGuard rules if using

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ RTK Query caching enabled (reduces API calls)
- ✅ Pagination on list screens
- ⚠️ No image optimization yet
- ⚠️ No lazy loading for heavy components
- ⚠️ Socket connections not optimized (should disconnect on background)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement missing screens** (priority order):
   - ChatDetail (for real-time messaging demo)
   - MatchDetail and CreateMatch
   - VenueDetail and CreateBooking
   - TournamentDetail with bracket view

2. **Complete Socket.IO integration**:
   - Connect chat UI to Socket.IO events
   - Implement message send/receive in real-time
   - Handle typing indicators and read receipts

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Add Firebase config files
   - Implement FCM token registration
   - Handle push notifications

4. **Testing with backend**:
   - Update .env with backend URL
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Fix any schema mismatches

5. **Polish**:
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Improve error messages
   - Add success feedback
   - Implement pull-to-refresh everywhere
