3. **Reusability**: Components are genuinely reusable
4. **TypeScript**: Caught many potential issues early

### Future Improvements
1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for new components
2. **Storybook**: Consider adding component playground
3. **Accessibility**: Enhance screen reader support
4. **Performance**: Profile and optimize animations

## 📈 Impact Assessment

### Before
- Duplicated empty state code across 8 screens

- Manual button group layouts

### After
- Single EmptyState component used everywhere
- Single ParticipantList component with variants
- Reusable SearchBar and FilterChips
