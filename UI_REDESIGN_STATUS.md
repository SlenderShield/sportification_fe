## 💡 Design Patterns Established

### Consistent Patterns Applied Across All Screens
1. **Staggered animations** - FadeInDown with 50-100ms delays
2. **Card-based layouts** - Information grouped in elevated cards
3. **Icon-first design** - MaterialCommunityIcons for visual hierarchy
4. **Empty states** - Helpful messages with icons
5. **Loading states** - Skeleton loaders for content
6. **Pull-to-refresh** - Branded colors on all list screens
7. **FAB placement** - Primary actions in bottom-right
8. **Status indicators** - Semantic color-coded badges/chips
9. **Role-based UI** - Conditional buttons based on user permissions
10. **Theme integration** - All colors, spacing, typography from theme

### Animation Guidelines
- **List items**: 50-100ms staggered delays
- **Form elements**: 100-500ms sequential delays
- **Press feedback**: Scale to 0.95-0.96 with opacity fade
- **Transitions**: Spring physics for natural motion
- **Timing**: Fast (150ms), Normal (250ms), Slow (350ms)

### Accessibility Standards
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 48dp for all interactive elements
- **Contrast ratios**: WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 for text)
- **Text scaling**: Dynamic type support via typography scale
- **Icon semantics**: All icons paired with meaningful text
- **Color independence**: Never rely on color alone for meaning

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### Component Usage Best Practices
1. Always use theme values instead of hardcoded colors
2. Apply consistent spacing using theme.spacing
3. Use semantic color names (success, error, warning, info)
4. Leverage existing components before creating new ones
5. Follow established animation patterns
6. Test in both light and dark modes
7. Ensure all touch targets meet 48dp minimum
8. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

### Performance Considerations
1. Use FlatList for long lists with proper optimization
2. Memoize expensive computations with useMemo
3. Use React.memo for components that don't change often
4. Keep animations at 60fps with hardware acceleration
5. Lazy load heavy components
6. Optimize images before inclusion
7. Profile animations to prevent jank

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visual testing in light mode
- [ ] Visual testing in dark mode
- [ ] Test all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify animations are smooth
- [ ] Check accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes
- [ ] Verify theme switching works
- [ ] Test loading and error states
- [ ] Validate form inputs
- [ ] Check empty states display
